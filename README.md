### Step 1: Set up the User Interface (UI)
1. Create a new Android Studio project.
2. Design the UI layout in the `activity_main.xml` file. Include EditText fields for entering the amount to convert, Spinner or AutoCompleteTextView for selecting the currency to convert from and to, and a Button to perform the conversion.
3. Add appropriate TextViews to display the conversion result.

### Step 2: Implement Currency Conversion Logic
1. Create a class to handle currency conversion logic, for example, `CurrencyConverter`.
2. Use a currency exchange API to fetch the latest exchange rates. You can use free APIs like Open Exchange Rates or fixer.io. Make sure to read their documentation to understand how to make requests.
3. Implement methods to perform currency conversion based on the exchange rates obtained from the API.

### Step 3: Handle User Input and Interaction
1. In your main activity (`MainActivity.java`), reference the UI elements and set up event listeners for the conversion button.
2. When the conversion button is clicked, retrieve the amount to convert and the selected currencies from the UI.
3. Call the appropriate method in the `CurrencyConverter` class to perform the conversion.
4. Update the UI with the conversion result.

### Step 4: Test Your App
1. Run your app on an emulator or a physical device.
2. Test various conversion scenarios to ensure accuracy.
3. Handle errors gracefully, such as network errors or invalid user input.
